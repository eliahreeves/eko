## General Info
We wanted to create an app that functions similarly to X (twitter) or Threads. We are currently in development of the app, adding new functionalities, patching bugs, and improving the user experience every week! The app is in beta on Test Flight and has over 30 current users.

For the core app, we used Flutter in an MVVM architecture. To accomplish MVVM we utilized Provider for state management and Get_It for dependency injection.
